List of tools and platforms I use for personal and development management.

## Personal
[Todoist](https://todoist.com)
* What it is: a simple task management.
* Why I use it: it's simple to track by time. I can schedule tasks to `each-day` or `each week`; I can separate tasks by projects; I can view tasks for `today`, `next 7 days` or grouped by importance.

[Organizze](https://www.organizze.com.br/)
* What it is: a personal financial controller.
* Why I use it: to keep my debts under controll =P.

[Toggl](https://www.toggl.com)
* What it is: a time tracking.
* Why I use it: in my job, i work with so many projects and many managers. It helps me to track extra hour jobs and make time reports for my company.


## Project Management
[Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/): is cool but much expensive. I think it must have a free plan for small teams (or open source projects).


## Mobile
